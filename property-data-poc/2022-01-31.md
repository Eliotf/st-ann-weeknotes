# üìù¬†Weeknotes #2 - land and property data proof of concept

Hi all,

Thanks for joining our show and tell earlier, and welcome to the second weeknotes for the land and property data proof of concept. In future, we are hoping to share these more widely, but for now it‚Äôs just for the people who came to the show and tell.

A reminder that we are exploring the art of the possible for simpler, fairer, more efficient, devolved land and property taxation in Wales. We want to be ambitious, but humble, and:

Bring the opportunities and challenges to life
Give Ministers potential policy options
Be clear about the scale of ambition and where to start
Demonstrate new ways of working

## Working in the open and stakeholders

Meetings have started with key stakeholders to update and/or share plans for the project. We‚Äôve also been finalising copy and translations for the project website and setting up a github organisation for the WRA.

## Roadmapping

Agile projects need a roadmap - one that evolves as we learn more through prototyping, workshops and user research. We‚Äôve made a start and the high-level view looks like this:

## Worked examples

Each week we are aiming to build out our understanding of the property and land data spine and the types of services it could support. This week our aims were:

Start to show what we mean by a data spine
Start to understand what attributes might it need for calculating LTT as it is today
Start to explore what attributes localised LTT might require and how we might store the rules as geospatial data

We used Jupyter Notebook, a data science tool, to create a prototype of the data spine containing records of two fictional properties. We then used those records to calculate LTT as it is today, and a theoretical implication of a localised LTT.

## Focus for next week

* More LTT scenarios to build out spine attributes, with focus on location data and existing identifiers
* Blogpost and project website soft launch
* Meeting and working with more stakeholders
