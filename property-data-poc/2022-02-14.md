# üìù¬†Weeknotes #4 - land and property data proof of concept

Thanks for joining our show and tell earlier for the land and property data proof of concept.

This week was a consolidation sprint, so in place of weeknotes, we‚Äôve attached the slides. Normal service will be resumed next week.

For anyone who who is new to the project this week, please let us know if you would like us to forward previous weeknotes to you.

Finally, here are the links to ...
