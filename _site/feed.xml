&lt;p&gt;As a reminder, we are a team from Sport England and FF Studio working together on the Open Funding Pilot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will help Sport England try new ways of working and new funding models to enable them to get more people in underserved communities active. It will also show the wider Sport England organisation what delivery looks like if we &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlassian.com/blog/productivity/shorten-feedback-loops-reduce-teams-stress&quot;&gt;shorten feedback cycles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weeknotes are a quick recap of the important things a team has done each week, what we‚Äôve learned, and what‚Äôs the plan for next week. They also help us work in the open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;this-week&quot;&gt;This week:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;After useful feedback from Sian and others, we made prototype 2 with a different platform, Typeform.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We reviewed several form platforms: Google Forms, Typeform, Paperform, Jotform and SurveyMonkey. Our professional experience makes us feel these systems would create a poor user experience and would generate more calls to the helpline. Typeform currently leads the pack because it lets us design well, provide useful contextual information to the applicant, has solid usability, has question branching and save-and-resume, and is GDPR compliant.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We met with Steve to give him an update on our first 3 weeks and shared our current prototype as a prompt for discussion and questions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cassie met with Greg and Jo from the RFI team to talk about their timelines so we can align our comms&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Comments from Steve and some research from the First Service Team prompted us to start exploring other formats of information submission, like audio and video&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Research: we want to test our prototype with people and have booked some sessions for the week 30 Oct. We are talking to two groups, people from sports organisations and some other funders.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Retrospective: we met to discuss how the work is going. It‚Äôs exhilarating working in a small, collaborative team with a bias to action and outcomes, but we‚Äôre keeping a close eye on timescales. We‚Äôre trying to get a lot built quickly, primarily to meet a deadline in December. So we know we need to keep moving at pace. One of our biggest risks is learning something very important very late in the project, so we will start communicating more widely soon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prototype screenshots:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;next-week&quot;&gt;Next week:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Share more widely&lt;/em&gt;: We‚Äôd like to meet more people and share what we‚Äôve been doing more widely, so we‚Äôre planning on a show and tell for colleagues working on the Responsive Framework and Open Funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Iterate the prototype with what we‚Äôve learned&lt;/em&gt;: We‚Äôre going to prepare for our research sessions the week of the 30th by being clear on what we want to learn (our research hypotheses) and writing discussion guides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are a team from Sport England and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ff.studio&quot;&gt;FF Studio&lt;/a&gt; working together on the Open Funding Pilot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will &lt;strong&gt;help Sport England try new ways of working and new funding models to enable them to get more people in underserved communities active&lt;/strong&gt;. It will also show the wider Sport England organisation what transformational delivery looks like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;9-13-october-2023&quot;&gt;9-13 October 2023&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;we-made-decisions&quot;&gt;We made decisions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We‚Äôll constrain the pilot to tier 1 funding (up to ¬£250,000) - because this makes assessment, decision making, governance, contracting simpler for Sport England&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We‚Äôll keep the pilot closed - constrained to a list held by the Strategic Partners team - because this is a pilot happening shortly before the December holiday break and we don‚Äôt want to inundate Sport England with support queries. We still think we‚Äôll learn a lot of things that will be useful for an open fund later on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;we-made-a-prototype-form&quot;&gt;We made a prototype form&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The form asks applicants questions that relate to eligibility (there‚Äôs some branching logic: if you say (for example) that you want more than ¬£250k, the form ends early with a sorry). Also some details on your project, its outcomes and measurement, and your organisation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It‚Äôs a form using Google Forms and a Google Sheets spreadsheet as its data store.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This first prototype is to help us define the criteria for the fund, and get questions answered. It isn‚Äôt something we‚Äôll test with applicants. When making decisions about the prototype, we leaned into riskier choices. Both to test those choices, and also to encourage conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also added questions about accessibility and inclusion, and about climate change, because making an impact in 2023 requires engaging with those things, not ignoring them. In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/oct/11/sport-england-tells-sports-fight-climate-crisis-or-youll-get-no-funding&quot;&gt;recent article in The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, Sport England chair Chris Boardman says that sports needs to step up when it comes to climate change - which is awesome. And using this a way to figure out how to make that real feels like a good idea. We hope this work helps to find some new norms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;we-have-questions&quot;&gt;We have questions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can a form be short/applicant-friendly and ask for everything needed to make a funding decision? - We‚Äôll explore this with Sian next week.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How might the affordances of different tech platforms change the applicant‚Äôs response? Is Google Form the right platform to use?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Even though it‚Äôs a closed pilot, can our learnings contribute to diversifying applicants in the future?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What cohorts might we split the list into, and how might that change the way we treat different applicants? - Cassie is exploring this with Greg, Ed and Jo, and helping us find the way to some answers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;next-week&quot;&gt;Next week&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Meet again with Sian and others, and catch up with Steve when he‚Äôs back from his hols&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Start looking at some assessor workflow&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Decide on Google Forms vs Typeform for next prototype&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-6-october-2023&quot;&gt;2-6 October 2023&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week the team gathered: Anna Goss, Eliot Fineberg, Kim Morley, Sonia Turcotte and Rod McLaren from FF Studio, and Cassie Burgess from Sport England.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We agreed our ‚Äúpoint of departure‚Äù: purpose, outcomes, target audience, roles and ways of working, success criteria, ‚Äúfiasco criteria‚Äù (failures to avoid), and other projects that connect to this.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We identified high level ‚Äújobs to be done‚Äù (apply for funding, score applications, remit successful funding, etc). These prompted some assumptions and questions that we will need to explore and answer.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We started building a schedule: we know we need to move quickly. The critical milestones are: publish the pilot w/c 6 Nov, and give applicants answers w/c 18 Dec.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We also started desk research into how other organisations are approaching open sport funding: Sport Wales, Sports Scotland, Sport Unites, Angus Irvine, Go! London and others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these are documented on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVNfn2G4I=/&quot;&gt;Miro board&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next week&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Talk to subject matter experts in SE (Sian Jones, Jo) next week&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Build a prototype to start conversation about what‚Äôs working and what isn‚Äôt&lt;/li&gt;
