      <h1 id="weeknotes-1">üìù¬†Weeknotes #1</h1>

<p>We are a team from Sport England and FF Studio working together on the Open Funding Pilot.</p>

<p>It will <strong>help Sport England try new ways of working and new funding models to enable them to get more people in underserved communities active</strong>. It will also show the wider Sport England organisation what transformational delivery looks like.</p>

<p>Weeknotes are a quick recap of the important things a team has done each week, what we‚Äôve learned, and what‚Äôs the plan for next week. They also help us work in the open.</p>

<h2 id="2-6-october-2023">2-6 October 2023</h2>

<p>This week the team gathered: Anna Goss, Eliot Fineberg, Kim Morley, Sonia Turcotte and Rod McLaren from FF Studio, and Cassie Burgess from Sport England.</p>

<ol>
  <li>We agreed our ‚Äúpoint of departure‚Äù: purpose, outcomes, target audience, roles and ways of working, success criteria, ‚Äúfiasco criteria‚Äù (failures to avoid), and other projects that connect to this.</li>
  <li>We identified high level ‚Äújobs to be done‚Äù (apply for funding, score applications, remit successful funding, etc). These prompted some assumptions and questions that we will need to explore and answer.</li>
  <li>We started building a schedule: we know we need to move quickly. The critical milestones are: publish the pilot w/c 6 Nov, and give applicants answers w/c 18 Dec.</li>
  <li>We also started desk research into how other organisations are approaching open sport funding: Sport Wales, Sports Scotland, Sport Unites, Angus Irvine, Go! London and others.</li>
</ol>

<p>All of these are documented on our <a href="https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVNfn2G4I=/">Miro board</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Next week</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Talk to subject matter experts in SE (Sian Jones, Jo) next week</li>
  <li>Build a prototype to start conversation about what‚Äôs working and what isn‚Äôt</li>
</ul>
